*Sahil Loomba, Alexandre de Figueiredo, Simon Piatek, Kristen de Graaf, Heidi Larson*

This repository contains code and data for our paper in [*Nature Human Behaviour*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01056-1) on measuring the impact of exposure to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on the intent to vaccinate in the UK and USA.

## Jupyter Notebooks
These notebooks are intended to aid importing, transforming, and analysing the survey data in this study. You may use [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view these notebooks, or view their static (.html) versions in `.doc/`, or view them on OSF (note: OSF link currently hosts a preprint version of the manuscript).

1. `tables_figures.ipynb`: generates all figures and tables of the paper
2. `import_data.ipynb`: demo of reading and transforming survey data for use in any downstream statistical modeling; [~~view on OSF~~](https://osf.io/ej4c6/)
3. `statistical_analyses.ipynb`: demo statistical modeling and generation of figures and tables in the paper; [~~view on OSF~~](https://osf.io/b3qkc/)

## Directory Structure
1. `.dat/`: contains processed survey data; sufficient to run all statistical analyses in the paper
2. `.doc/`: contains full survey questionnaire and static (.html) versions of the Jupyter Notebooks
3. `.src/paper.py`: contains helper functions to generate all figures and tables of the paper
4. `.src/models.py`: contains functions to define and fit all Bayesian models described in the paper
5. `.src/utils.py`: contains helper functions to import and transform survey data, compute and plot posterior statistics
6. `.src/bayesoc.py`: defines python classes `Dim()`, `Outcome()`, `Society()` and `Model()` to implement general Bayesian socio-demographic models using [pystan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Reproduction attempt from the SwissRN ReproHack

We attempted to reproduce the analyes in this paper at the [SwissRN
ReproHack](https://www.reprohack.org/event/16/). We had to install some older
versions of Python and Pystan, as it doesn't work with newer versions (for
example, Pystan >= 3.0 is now imported as stan and not as pystan as in the paper). Also there seems to be
a problem with pandas, we had to modify the code at 2 places. 

We tried to make a
reproducible environment using a Dockercontainer. When Docker with root rights
is installed, the following command executed in a shell in the root directory of
the repository should open a jupyter notebook which can be used to reproduce the
results

``` sh
make
```
